INTERVALS
---------

These are some simple scripts related to the paper
"Matrix Method for Persistence Modules on Commutative Ladders of Finite Type"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10027

In particular, the script mp_tools computes the arrangement of block statuses
given the ordering of intervals specified in that paper
(i.e. structure of AR quiver induces a partial order on intervals b:d,
then resolve ambiguities using reverse lex order)


REQUIREMENTS
------------
numpy
pytest (for tests)


USAGE
-----
To run the main script
>> python mp_tools.py

To run the tests, (in the project folder)
>> python -m pytest
